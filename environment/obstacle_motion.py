"""
Deterministic smooth obstacle motion, used for evaluation only.

Each obstacle follows a closed-form path in simulation time t (seconds):

    p(t) = p0 + sum_k A_k * (sin(w_k * t + phi_k) - sin(phi_k))
    v(t) =      sum_k A_k * w_k * cos(w_k * t + phi_k)

A, w, phi are drawn per axis from an RNG seeded by (movement_seed, obs_id),
so the path depends only on t and is identical on every run / process.

Guarantees:
    p(0) = p0                       (start position is the task's position)
    |p(t) - p0| <= amplitude        per axis
    |v(t)|      <= max_speed        (Euclidean)

Optional floor (task key "floor", a height in metres): the path is mirrored
at that height, so an obstacle that would sink below it bounces back up
instead -- paths no longer have to be rejected for going under the floor,
which biased accepted paths towards drifting upwards. Mirroring keeps all
three guarantees (as long as p0 is at or above the floor). Tasks without
"floor" move exactly as before.

Task file format (seed only, motion params shared by all obstacles):
    "obstacle_motion": {
        "movement_seed": 1234,
        "max_speed": 0.2,
        "amplitude": 0.3,
        "num_terms": 3,
        "floor": 0.0                (optional)
